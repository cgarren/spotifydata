## TODO
### General
* ~~Convert to pure javascript~~
* ~~Style login page~~
* ~~Make some javascript to deploy navbar html across all pages in common.js~~
* Add Logout button

### Song Info Page
* ADD A WAY TO SEARCH BY TRACK DATA!!! (If possible)
* Make numbers in chart easier to read and understand
* ~~Add a 30 sec preview to track data page using preview_url field~~
* ~~Add album art~~
* Generally make the page more appealing

### Account Stats Page
* Account Info (minutes listened/tracks played/time of day most active?, add time range slider!!)
* Top Artists/Top tracks
* Recently Played
* Followers
* Playlists
* Reccomendations
* Insights (like Spotify.me)

### New Music Page (filter by user's top artists, maybe a "for you" tab-ML?, using Spotify rec's?)
* New Singles
* New Albums
* Sort new/popular/playlist/library music by attributes (find the most danceable tracks, see which tracks were mastered the loudest, find out which songs are in the key of C, etc...)

### Small link to other cool Spotify sites (at bottom of page)
* Kaleidosync

### Queue Manager
* Ability to save current/different queues and batch add songs to queue
